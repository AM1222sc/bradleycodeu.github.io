p5js - a JavaScript library based on the Processing language that was created to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners

JavaScript - a programming language created to add dynamic behavior, store information, and handle requests and responses on a webpage. Along with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core languages of the Web.

ES6 - also known as ECMAScript 6, ECMAScript 2015, or JavaScript 6 was finalized in June 2015. This update added significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including class declarations, block scoped variables, and constants

abstraction - representing essential features without including complex details. Allows programmers to implement efficient models of complicated real-world entities/items.

parent class - also known as a superclass, a class from that can pass on its instance variable and methods to its children. More generic than it's child classes.

superclass - also known as a parent class, a class from that can pass on its instance variable and methods to its children. More generic than it's child classes.

child class - also known as a subclass, a class that contains all the features of the parent class, but may have new features added or redefine existing features. More specialized than the parent class.

subclass - also known as a child class, a class that contains all the features of the parent class, but may have new features added or redefine existing features. More specialized than the parent class

inheritance - the relationship in which one class is based on another class while passing on instance variable and methods

is-a - the relationship between parent and child classes. For example, if Vehicle is the parent class and Truck is the child class, then Truck _____ Vehicle

containment - the relationship in which an object of one class includes an instance of an object from another class

has-a - the relationship where one object belongs to another object. For example, if a Radio object is an instance variable within the Truck class, then Truck _____ Radio

modulo - a mathmatic operation that finds the remainder after division

object-oriented programming - an approach to programming centered on modeling real-world entities with both attributes and behaviors. Its three pillars include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

object - a data structure that contains attributes and behaviors. A software model representing an entity either physical (a box, a car, etc) or conceptual (a chemical process, a sale, driving directions, etc)

class - a blueprint for creating objects with common attributes and behaviors

attribute - a property that describes the state of an object. Also known as an instance variable. For example, xLocation, yLocation, color, speed.

instance variable - a property that describes the state of an object. Also known as an attribute. For example, xLocation, yLocation, color, speed.

behavior - a method that either determines how an object acts, is changed, or provides information about its state.

method - a function that belongs to a class

this -  a keyword that refers to a specific instance of a class rather than referring to a global variable

constructor - a method of a class that initializes an object of that type

instantiate - the creation of an object (an instance) from a class

instance - an object created from a class

getter - a method that fetches private data that is stored within an object. Also known as an accessor.

accessor - a method that fetches private data that is stored within an object. Also known as a getter.

setter - a method used to control changes to an object's internal state. Also known as a mutator.

mutator - a method used to control changes to an object's internal state. Also known as a setter.

argument - a value that is passed into a method call from outside of the method.

parameter - a variable that is required by a method definition and used inside the method code.

finite state machine - a hardware or software device that has multiple modes and that it can be in only one mode at a time. For example, a traffic light can be red, yellowTurningGreen, green, and yellowTurningRed

game state - the concept that a game consists of multiple scenes and that it can only be in one scene at a time. For example, titleScreen, inGame, loseScreen, and winScreen

edge case - a problem or situation that occurs at minimum and maximum values of a conditional. For example, an issue with bouncing off of the screen boundaries.

encapsulation -  the concept of combining data attributes and behaviors into one object

polymorphism - being able to use objects from multiple classes in the same way because the classes use the same method names. For example, if all classes have a move method and a show method.
