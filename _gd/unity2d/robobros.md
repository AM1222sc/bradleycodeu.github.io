Follow the directions in [Sprites ch 13.pdf](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1zINBbLCd0L7EHWJO13Nqod-MBS0ooOtW) and [Switching Between Scenes (Unity 5).pdf](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Wxudt7eFLwOWAdjpVOpE_aoQSkBzWFOp) to help you complete these steps

  - Download [Hour14Package.unitypackage](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1YMXdF7dxjqVV_kjIt00OVWWsFKjNFyPT)
  - Download [ranger.png](/gd/unity2d/ranger.png)
  - Add Ranger to the scene with a Box Collider 2D
  - Add RobotBoy
  - Download a "steel beam texture" (from Google Images) for the platforms. Create 5 or more platforms with space in between so the player MUST jump
  - Move Ranger to the end of the level so that the player knows when they've reached the end (Ranger is basically going to be Princess Peach for this project).
  - Create your own "reset if you fall" script
  - Make the camera follow RobotBoy (basically Mario)
  - Create a background image. Create a [parallax effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) by placing the background image at a z between 5-20 and change the Main Camera to Perspective instead of Othographic.
  - Create a menu (starting screen) for your RobotBoy game. With the title of the game, your name, and a start/play button
