With your team, use the Unity "Collab" feature to:
<ul>
  <li>create a title scene with:
    1. a large title
    1. small text that explains the multiple ways to win
    1. small text that explains the controls for P1 and P2
    1. [a PLAY button that switches the game to the next scene](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TKYCbEmYhe-DC5wlI4m_otLzVN0vWpud/view?usp=sharing)
  </li>
  <li>create a multiplayer game [with separate controls for each player](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_dUAMNMbJ_wj6xhbukLLLx7cpQQXhUi/view?usp=sharing)
  </li>
  <li>with multiple win conditions (for example, don't die, collect the majority of collectibles, hit a target first, complete the maze first, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>use [UI text to notify the users when someone wins](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aJMR4aX8mXCwkHOF7uBjV8nTWzncxOeM/view?usp=sharing)
  </li>
</ul>
Here is a simple [demo 2-player game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KjcdLgSRuclSQFuYQMUJ3Z3maMyHE6cf/view?usp=sharing)
