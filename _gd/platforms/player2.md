Remix a game and add a 2nd player to a game (platformer, RPG-style UDLR game, or bubble game). I would *STRONGLY PREFER* that you remix a classmate's game, but you could also remix your own game.

Your finished game MUST have:
  - an obviously different sprite for P2 (must not be the EXACT same image as P1)
  - a Title Screen with controls for P1 and P2 (for example, "P1=WASD P2=arrow keys")
  - background music
  - four or more sound effects
  - a parent class (Sprite) and child classes
  - collectables and/or enemies
  - a Win Screen that says either "Player 1 Wins" or "Player 2 Wins"
  - Should NOT be able to complete the game in less than 30 seconds. Add more objectives or levels if necessary.
