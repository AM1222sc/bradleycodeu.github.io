Remix a game so that is has 5 or more level. The game could be a platformer, RPG-style UDLR game, or bubble game. I would *STRONGLY PREFER* that you remix a classmate's game, but you could also remix your own game.

Your finished game MUST have:
  - background music
  - four or more sound effects
  - a Title Screen
  - some Intro-Level Screens (for example, "Level 1 Click To Start", "Level 2 Click To Start", etc)
  - a Win Screen (unless you make it endless-runner style that only gets progressively harder)
  - a Lose Screen
  - Each level MUST get progressively more difficult.
  - Balance the game. It must be possible to complete a level and possible to lose.
  - Should NOT be able to complete the game in less than 60 seconds. Add more levels if necessary.
