1. Watch the following sections.
  - 7:16 Primitive Objects
  - 13:35 Colliders and Rigidbodies
  - 23:42 Triggers (you cannot do the coding in this section, but WATCH the coding portion)
  - 34:34 Materials

Complete:Â 

1. Create a new unity project called 'ChainReactions'.
1. Add walls on 3 or 4 sides, around the edge of the ground. Use cubes for this. Create a new material and make it a different color to apply to the walls.
1. Add 5 or more 3D Game Objects that have a Rigidbody and interact with each other (maybe shapes bouncing off each other or maybe dominos). You might want to add a ramp for things to roll down. Every object should have a Material (either a solid color OR an image).
1. Increase or decrease gravity. Click Edit > Project Settings > Physics > Gravity.
1. Try making giving some of the objects a [Bouncy material](https://knightcube.medium.com/how-to-make-game-objects-bounce-in-unity-3a456c34c375). Use Create > Physic Material. Set Friction to 0 and Bounciness to 1.
1. Submit a screen recording of your Game scene. [https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder](https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen-recorder)
