Read this tutorial about the [HTML5 \<nav\> tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp)

For this project you will work in a group of 2-4 people. The number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 2 other pages
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 3 other pages
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages

Ideas for "other pages" include:
  - Contact Us
  - Employment
  - News
  - Our Games
  - Gift Cards
  - Our History/Our Story/About Us
  - Help/Support
  - Frequently Asked Questions

Your website must contain:
  1.  an index.html homepage page with a logo and links to all of the other pages
  1.  all other pages have:
      - same navigation system (like a nav bar) as all pages with links to every page on the site
      - an h1
      - a paragraph with some text
      - one (or more) images
