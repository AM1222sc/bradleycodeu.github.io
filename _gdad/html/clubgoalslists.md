Watch this [KhanAcademy tutorial about HTML lists](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/pt/html-lists)

In this project you will create an unordered list of fake video games and an ordered list of Directions.

Continue working on your webpage from the Simpler Is Better project. At the top of the page you should already have the name for your fake game development company (for example, Low-key Flex Studios). The name should be a heading (H1), that is *centered* and at the top of the page. Below the heading, you should already have a logo.

Add your fake video games as an UNORDERED list. For example...

Our Video Games:

  - Super Stamp Collector
  - Bewildering Sailor: 25th Anniversary Edition
  - Street Cheese Ultra


Finally, give either directions to the office or directions to purchase/download/install your games as an ORDERED list. For example...

Directions to Our Office Building:

  1.  Find some pixie dust and sprinkle it on yourself
  1.  Think of a wonderful thought
  1.  Fly toward the second star to the right, and a straight-on 'til morning

A few things to note for this project...

  - Lists look best when they are NOT centered
  - You should not have paragraphs inside of your list items. Don't do this... &lt;li> &lt;p> text &lt;/p> &lt;/li>
  - You should have BOTH an unordered list with Video Games AND an ordered list with Directions

Turn in your repl.it URL when finished
