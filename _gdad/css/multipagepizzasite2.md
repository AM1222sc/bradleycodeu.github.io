title: Multi-page Site 2
---

For this project you will continue working on your multi-page website with the same group of 2-4 people.

### Each person will ADD ONE NEW PAGE (with an h1, text, and image) to the site.

You MUST add an [HTML comment](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp) on each page that says the name of the programmer. For example, `<!-- coded by Mr. Riley -->`

The FINAL number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages (add 2 new pages)
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 6 other pages (add 3 new pages)
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 8 other pages (add 4 new pages)

Ideas for "other pages" include:

  - Our History/Our Story/About Us
  - Help/Support
  - Frequently Asked Questions

## Add CSS

Which type of CSS should you use for a multi-page site?
  -   [Inline CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_inline)
  -   [Internal CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_internal)
  -   [External CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_css_external)

### Just like you split up the HTML coding work, you should split up the CSS coding work so that each person in the group writes some CSS code.

You MUST add a [CSS comment](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/comments-in-css/) to note the name of the programmer that wrote each CSS rule. For example, `/* CSS for h1, h2, and img coded by Mr. Riley */` and `/* CSS for nav and links by Megan W. */`

Your website MUST have a consistent style across all pages:

  - same navigation system (like a nav bar) on all pages
  - your navigation uses a small (no larger than 100px wide) logo instead of saying "home." The logo is an anchor/link that links back to index.html

CSS code that needs added by your group:
  1. navigation
      1. use a different font in your navigation (not the same as your normal text)
      1. use a different text size in your navigation (not the same as your normal text)
      1. use a different background color in your navigation (not the same as the page background, not black or white)
      1. use a solid 2 pixel light color border (not black or white) around the navigation on all pages
  1. body
      1. same colorful background (not black or white) on all pages
      1. same colorful text (not black or white) on all pages
      1. use a slightly different text size (not the default 16px)
  1. h1 and h2
      1. use a different font
      1. use a different text color
  1. links
      1. same link color (not the default blue) on all pages
      1. same [visited link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp) color (not the default purple) on all pages
  1. images
      1. same solid 2 pixel dark color border (not black or white) around all images on all pages
      1. set the [max width](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_max-width.asp) so all images must be this specific size or smaller
  1. paragraphs
      1. add a 10 pixel margin and 10 pixel padding
      1. add a colorful background (not black or white)


DON'T FORGET: You MUST add a [CSS comment](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/comments-in-css/) to note the name of the programmer that wrote each CSS rule. For example, `/* CSS for h1, h2, and img coded by Mr. Riley */` and `/* CSS for nav and links by Megan W. */`
