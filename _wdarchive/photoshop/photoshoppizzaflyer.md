Using Photoshop, create a flyer for your pizza restaurant. Each student must create their own unique flyer.

Must include:

  - Name of your fake pizza restaurant
  - Logo
  - Prices for 3 or more items
  - Your fake restaurant's fake phone number
  - Your fake restaurant's fake address
  - Must be 8.5" x 11"
