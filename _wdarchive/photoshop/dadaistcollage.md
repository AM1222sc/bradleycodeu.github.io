Using Photoshop, create a Dadaist Collage. **BEFORE YOU BEGIN**, pick a theme that is meaningful for you (for example... Cleveland OR marching band OR Black Lives Matter OR the Chicago Cubs).

MUST include:

  - A tan/brown/sepia-tone newspaper background
  - 10 or more overlapping cut-out photos (with their backgrounds removed)
  - Your theme as text within the collage
  - Add an Adjustment Layer Filter to colorize everything in your collage
