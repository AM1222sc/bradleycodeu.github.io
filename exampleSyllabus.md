### Workflow

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>
* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

Enabling `Edit`->`Automatically Sync after Committing` is recommended. Here are the steps:

1. Fork (create your own branch of) the repository for the exercise/project.
1. Clone (download) the repository to your computer.
1. Edit the files to complete your solution.
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the results, and repeat.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push (sync) up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (merging the code) on the original repository.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions!  You are welcome to open the pull request early as a work-in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question.
