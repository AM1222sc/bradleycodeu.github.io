Your Scrum team worked together to create two iterations of an app that draws art scenes: a city scene, a country scene, and an underwater scene. There should be a few functions that you "developed individually on your own"

### You MUST turn in THREE files for this project:

1. Each group member will turn in a copy of the finished "City/Country/Underwater Art Scene" Python code as a PDF file (all of the Python files should be in one PDF). Why a PDF? Because you will turn in a PDF of your code for the AP exam.

     - One easy way to save your code as a PDF is to copy/paste it into a Google Doc. In Google Docs, select File > Download > PDF to save as a PDF.

1. Use your iPad's screen recording feature to record a demo video of your "City/Country/Underwater Art Scene". ```Your video MUST be less than 60 seconds.```

1. Written Reflection:
    - [Create a copy of this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eG56W2PL-lHfIf58z5y8nN5wpdgjaA6HQ2pIwR8bmko/copy)

    - Answer all of the questions about your "City/Country/Underwater Art Scene" project.

    - Turn in a copy of this Google Doc as a PDF. Select File > Download > PDF to save a Google Doc as a PDF.
