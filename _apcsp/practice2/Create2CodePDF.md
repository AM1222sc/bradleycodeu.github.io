title: Create 2 Code PDF
---
Each group member will turn in a copy of the finished "City/Country/Underwater Art Scene" Python code as a PDF file (all of the Python files should be in one PDF). Why a PDF? Because you will turn in a PDF of your code for the AP exam.


  - One easy way to save your code as a PDF is to copy/paste it into a Google Doc. In Google Docs, select File > Download > PDF to save as a PDF.
