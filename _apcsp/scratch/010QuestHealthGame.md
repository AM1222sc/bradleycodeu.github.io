  - MUST switch the backdrop costume and hide/show sprites in order to create a scene change. For example, touching the Cave Entrance switches the backdrop to the "cave" costume, hides the Cave Entrance sprite, and shows the Enemy sprite.
  - Player MUST have a health variable.
  - There MUST be some way for the player to re-gain health.
  - Create a way to win AND a way to lose. Let the player know how they win and how they lose by typing directions on the Narrative sprite.
