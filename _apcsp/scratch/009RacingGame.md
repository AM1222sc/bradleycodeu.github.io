Create a two player racing game. When left is pressed, *rotate to the left*. When right is pressed, *rotate right*. When up is pressed *move forward* in whatever direction you are facing.

Slow a player down if they are touching the green grass.

Players *MUST NOT* be able to simply turn around and touch the finish line. You must do *something* to prevent players from cheating like this.

Make three new sprites:
- a finish line
- text that says "Player 1 wins"
- text that says "Player 2 wins"

When a player touches the finish line, display EITHER "Player 1 wins" or "Player 2 wins" and then stop the game.
