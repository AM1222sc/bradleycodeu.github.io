  title: Bouncing Off The Walls
---
Switch to an animal other than the cat.

Write code so that your character (the sprite):

1. Is always moving forward
2. Bounces off the walls
3. Use the pen to trace its path
4. Legs are moving (or it's wings are flapping or whatever)
5. Does not flip upside down
6. Moves at random angles
