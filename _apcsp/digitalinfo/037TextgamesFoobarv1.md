Create your own text game based on Foobar The Bazbarian

You will be graded on the following requirements:

* Group of 3 = 12 rooms, 6 items
* Group of 4 = 16 rooms, 8 items
* Each of these rooms must have a unique description. NOT just "you're in a room"
* An item is something that the player can pick up like a new weapon, a health pack, coins, a potion, some food, a fidget-spinner, etc.
* Create an array that stores the room descriptions AND a different array that stores items that you can pick up. In v1, the player does NOT need to be able to pick up the item.
* Must be able to change locations and give a message like "You can't go there" when necessary.
