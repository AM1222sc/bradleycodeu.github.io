[Copy/Paste this map class](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ohiofi/a1fc5080137a832ea42bc1fa7adc8318/raw/f647a82336357a3a4b09c1a2a834c56e61b3bb64/map.py) into a new file, map.py

You will be graded on the following requirements:

1. Figure out a title for you game and visit [this site](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow&t=Game%20Title) to get an ASCII art version of your title.
1. More rooms (group of 3 = 21 total rooms, group of 4 = 28 total rooms). Each of these rooms must have a unique description. NOT just "you're in a room". Have 2 or more items for each person in your group.
1. Have 1 *special room* for each person in your group. A special room could be:
  - a battle with an enemy
  - a high-low number guessing game (to open a combination lock, for example)
  - a fill-in-the-blank quiz game (to figure out a computer password, for example)
  - a locked door that is unlocked if the player has the key in their inventory/backpack and types "use key"
1. Must use the Map class to draw a map for your game (hide or show the items is up to you).
1. Print the room description, any item in the room, any items in the player's inventory/backpack, and the possible commands that the player can type.
1. Must be able to change locations and give a message like "You can't go there" when necessary.
1. Must be able to collect an item (using "take"), place the item in the player's inventory/backpack, and remove the item from the room.
1. Must have a break in your while loop so that game ends if the user types "quit", loses the game, or wins the game.

``` Put your finished game on Trinket.io along with the map.py class. Turn in the URL for your finished game. ```
