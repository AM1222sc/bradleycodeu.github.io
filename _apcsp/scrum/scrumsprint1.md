Each day will begin with [The Daily Standup (aka The Daily Scrum)](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum) a standing (not sitting) meeting of 15 minutes or less. Taking turns, each member says:
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What will you do today?
  - Are there any "blockers" in your way? Any things on which you are currently stuck?
  - Update the [Scrum Board](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrum-tools/task-boards), if necessary

Your first meeting is also a [Sprint Planning meeting](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/sprint-planning-meeting) in which the team members select tasks from the Product Backlog that they plan on completing during the upcoming sprint. Place these tasks in the To Do column of your Scrum Board.
