Working ON YOUR OWN, you will use either paper, Notability, Google Docs, a spreadsheet, a text file, etc.
Convert the day of the month you were born to binary, then continue converting the following 9 numbers to binary.

For example...
  - if your birthday is March 14th, you will convert numbers 14-23 to binary.
  - if your birthday is September 1st, you will convert numbers 1-10 to binary.
  - if your birthday is December 31st, you will convert numbers 31-40 to binary.


If your birthday is the 31st, you would *start* like this...
```
Hint: 32s 16s 8s 4s 2s 1s
