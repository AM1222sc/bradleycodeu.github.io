Float        a floating-point decimal number. For example, 42.5, 0.001, or -3.729.


Function        a named group of programming instructions that performs a specific task separately from a main script and returns to the main script when it is complete. Reusable abstractions that reduce the complexity of writing and maintaining programs.


Function call        a request that runs the code inside of a function


Function definition        a block of code that includes the keyword def followed by a name, any arguments that are required, code inside the function, and an output that is returned


Hexadecimal        an 8-bit, base 16 counting system that uses the characters 0-9 and A-F


Import        allows you to use commands that are not built-in to Python. For example, tkinter windows, random numbers, math functions, or turtles.


Input        information that is given to the computer by a user, usually typed text and mouse clicks


Integer        a whole number. For example, 42, 0, or -3729.


Iteration        also known as a loop, a control structure in which commands are repeated either a set number of times, until a boolean condition is met, or forever


Latency        the time it takes for a bit to travel from its sender to its receiver


Local variable        variables created inside a function definition, that cannot be used outside the function


Mathematical operator        a mathematical character that takes two numbers and performs a calculation on them. For example, +


Octal        a 3-bit, base 8 counting system that uses the characters 0-7


Output        information that is given to the user by a computer, usually text, images, and sound


Prompt        a message or symbol indicating that the computer is waiting for user to provide input


Protocol        a set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices


Return        a keyword that tells the program to leave the function and send back a value


Scope        dictates what portions of the code can "see" or use a variable, typically derived from where the variable was first created
