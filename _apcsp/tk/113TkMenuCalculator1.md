Copy/paste this starter code: [https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Menu-Calc](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Menu-Calc)

Display a menu with prices for THREE items (for example, burger $4.99, chicken sandwich $3.99, and one other item). Your app is collecting how many of item 1, how many item 2, and how many item 3.

You MUST include...
- Labels for item names and prices
- an Entry widget for each item so that the user can say how many they want (you may NOT use Spinboxes)
- a Button

Create a function called isValidNumber that requires one argument: userinput. It returns true if the number can be converted to a number without crashing, otherwise it returns false.

When the customer clicks the SUBMIT button
  - you MUST validate the numbers
  - calculate the total price
  - create a messagebox that tells the customer the total price
  - if invalid numbers, display an error message
