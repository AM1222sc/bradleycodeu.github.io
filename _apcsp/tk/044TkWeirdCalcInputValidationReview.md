Project Details:

Using Mu or repl.it...

1. Create and Entry widget for number 1 and another Entry widget for number 2
2. Create a Button widget
3. Create 4 text Labels
5. When the Button is pressed:
   1. if NOT Validate input, print an error message in text Label 1.
   1. Otherwise, if input is valid:
      - Give the sum of the two numbers in text Label 1
      - Give the difference between the two numbers in text Label 2
      - Give the product of the two numbers (the result of multiplication) in text Label 3
      - If number 2 is not zero, give the quotient (the result of division) in text Label 4

Your final line of code MUST be mainloop(). This allows someone to simply click on your file and run your app. **mainloop** works kind of like a game loop that keeps the app running.
```python
mainloop() #include me as last line!!!
```
