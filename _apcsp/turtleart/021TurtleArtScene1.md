This project MUST be completed as a group of 2 or 3.

Decide if you will be creating an underwater scene, country scene, or city scene

You will write code to draw several things in your scene:
  - Group of 2 = draw 4 things by creating 4 functions
  - Group of 3 = draw 6 things by creating 6 functions

Here are some suggested "things" for your scene:

If underwater scene... | If country scene... | If city scene...
---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------
Water | Sky | Sky
Bubbles (random locations / sizes) | Sun or Moon (random location) | Sun or Moon (random location)
Seaweed (random locations / sizes) | Clouds (random locations / sizes) | Clouds (random locations / sizes)
Fish (random locations / sizes) | Ground with hills | Ground with river or ocean
Starfish | 	Trees (random locations / sizes) | Skyscrapers (random locations / sizes)
Crab (or other animal) | Barn (or similar) | Bridge (or similar)

Additional Requirements:
- Programmers' names MUST be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting). Check out [this example](https://trinket.io/python/52378ec006). Create a function called writeNames
- MUST use random shades of colors on EVERYTHING. The blue water or sky will randomly be set to a shade of blue. Each seaweed or each tree must have a random shade of green.
- Functions MUST be used properly and named with logical names (drawWater, makeSky, randomFish, etc)
- Each function MUST have comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment ```# draw fish tail```)
