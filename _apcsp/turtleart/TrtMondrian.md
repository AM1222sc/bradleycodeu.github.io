In this project you will create a Mondrian-style Drawing Generator.

### DIRECTIONS

Define a function that will draw ONE Rectangle. (You will use this in the main algorithm below)
  - Pick a fill color either white, blue, yellow, or red
  - Create a variable called height set it to 40 * a small random integer
  - Create a variable called width set it to 40 * a small random integer
  - Begin fill
  - Draw a rectangle using the height and width variable and 90-deg turns
  - End fill

Main Algorithm:
  - Create a for loop
    - Pick up the pen
    - Create a variable called x set it to 40 * a small random integer
    - Create a variable called y set it to 40 * a small random integer
    - Go to x, y
    - Call your draw one rectangle function
