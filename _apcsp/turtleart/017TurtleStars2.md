Write code that will draw stars **WITH NO INTERNAL WALLS**. It will create the outline of a 5-pointed star, 6-pointed, 7-pointed, 8-pointed, etc.

Ask the user "HOW MANY POINTS?"

Your code should use calculations (not x-y coodinates) to draw the shape.

I should be able to ask the program to draw something crazy like a 19-pointed star and it will draw it.
