title: Turtle Arguments and Shapes
---

You will create TWO functions. The purpose of this assignment is to create functions with arguments so that you can customize each shape by supplying different arguments.

NOTE: Both of your functions MUST use 2 or more arguments.

Pick 1 of these...

  - drawStar(size, color)
  - drawCircle(size, color)
  - drawPetal(size, color) // flower petal or football shape
  - drawHouse(size, color) // square with equilateral triangle roof
  - drawPentagon(size, color)
  - drawTriangle(size, color) // equilateral triangle
  - drawSquare(size, color)

Pick 1 of these...

  - drawRectangle(width, height)
  - drawPineTree(width, height) // a rectangle trunk and 2 or 3 triangles
  - drawRightTriangle(width, height)
  - drawEllipse(width, height)
  - drawRhombus(sideLength, angleOne)
  - drawParallelogram(sideLengthA, sideLengthB, angleOne)
  - drawTrapezoid(sideLengthA, sideLengthB, sideLengthC, angleOne)

Finally, create a function named main(). In this function, you will call your two functions and provide different arguments to demonstrate the custom shapes. The main function should contain at least 4 function calls.
