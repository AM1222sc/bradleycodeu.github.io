[Read this tutorial about using Python's input() function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp)

Ask the user "How many squares? Type 1-10" and then draw that many squares. Squares should be drawn one after another in a line.

All squares must be visible! If I ask for 5, I must be able to see 5.
