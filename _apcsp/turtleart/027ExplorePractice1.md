## Big Data Innovation

Choose an innovation related to big data that you and your partner find interesting. For this project, use a broad definition of an “innovation” and it doesn’t need to be a *new* invention.

*This is a two part project: create a Photo Collage and write a brief Written Report*

## Brainstorming

Start by going to [Google News (news.google.com)](https://news.google.com) and entering the name of something you and your partner are interested in, followed by the word “data” or “big data.” For example: “soccer big data,” “shopping big data,” “music big data.” It might take some searching, but you will find a few interesting things. Make sure you have at least three reputable sources for your innovation and how it uses data. Other Ideas:
- Smart grids, smart buildings, smart homes
- The data behind your favorite app
- Online shopping trends/recommendations
- Crowdsourcing
- Crowd-funding (Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, GoFundMe)
- reCAPTCHA
- GWAPs - Games With A Purpose
- Assistive technologies - aiding human vision, hearing, movement, etc.
- Machine learning
- Sports analytics
- Any kind of science data - physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, etc.

## Conducting Your Research

*Keep a list of websites/sources that you are using for research*

Key Information to Find:
- **Purpose**: the need, goal, or problem that led to the creation of the innovation. This is “what” the innovation was designed to do.
- **Effect on Society**: try to find a group that has benefited from the innovation. Describe the specific impact of the innovation on them in terms of society, economy, or culture. What is a negative effect that either IS happening or COULD happen as a result of this innovation working as intented? Do **NOT** bother saying:
  - hacking, privacy, security
  - it might be expensive
  - it might glitch, malfunction, or not work
- **Function**: how the innovation actually accomplishes its purpose. This typically means describing input/output or the way it consumes, produces, or transforms data. This is “how” the innovation actually works. Be specific!
- **Sources**: MUST include at least 3 news articles and the URLs for the news articles

## You will turn in two files:

1. Photo Collage:
  - *Keep a list of websites/sources that you are using for photos*. You will include these sources in your Written Report.
  - Working with your partner, create a photo collage. To make the photo collage, you might want to use Google Slides, PowerPoint, Google Docs, Word, Google Drawings, Photoshop, Canva app, PicCollage app, Pic Stitch app, or Adobe Spark Post app.
  - Save your photo collage as an image. You and your partner will turn in one copy of the photo collage.

2. Written Report:
  - [Create a copy of this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NlAIHUt_hhGzL7G-sl7bGK46AxVwf3qVz65HdNG1LG4/copy) and SHARE it with your partner.
  - Working with your partner, answer all five questions 2a-2e.
  -	You and your partner will turn in one copy of this Google Doc.
