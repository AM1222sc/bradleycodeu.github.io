title: Console Random Int Array

Concepts: arrays, random numbers, for loop, for each loop, modulus

Section 1: Generate and print...
- Create an array
- Using a for loop, randomly generate 20 positive integers and append them to the array
- Print a line that says "Full Array"
- Print the full contents of the array using a for loop

Section 2: Choose to do either Odd Integers or Even Integers. Here is an example of what you would do for Odd Integers...
- Print a line that says "Odd Integers"
- Next, use a FOR EACH loop to iterate through the array and print only the odd integers. (Hint: you must use modular division)

Section 3: Choose to do either Multiples of 3, Multiples of 4, or Multiples of 5. Here is an example of what you would do for Multiples of 3...
- Print a line that says "Multiples of 3"
- Next, use a FOR EACH loop to iterate through the array and print only the multiples of 3. (HINT: you must use modular division)
