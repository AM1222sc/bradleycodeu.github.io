Concepts: concatenation, len(), string indexing

Write a code to prompt the user to enter their first name. Your program will respond with a welcome message for the user (Hello Steve!) and then print some information about the user's first name (length, starts with, ends with).

Next, prompt the user to enter their last name. Print some information about the user's last name (length, starts with, ends with). Then print the full name (Your full name is Steve Jobs).

Finally, scream! Create a variable named myScream that contains empty string. Make a loop that repeats for the length of the first name + the length of the second name, concatenating an "A" to myScream each repetition. After the loop, concatenate an "!" and print it.

Sample Output:
```
Enter your first name: Steve
Hello Steve!
Length is
5
Starts with
S
Ends with
e
Enter your last name: Jobs
Length is
4
Starts with
J
Ends with
s
Your full name is Steve Jobs
AAAAAAAAA!
```
Sample Output 2:
```
Enter your first name: Bradley
Hello Bradley!
Length is
7
Starts with
B
Ends with
y
Enter your last name: Highschool
Length is
10
Starts with
H
Ends with
l
Your full name is Bradley Highschool
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
```
