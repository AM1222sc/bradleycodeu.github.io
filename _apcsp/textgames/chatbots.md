Read this w3schools tutorial about [Python dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp). Notice that dictionary items are presented in key/value pairs.

For this assignment you will create two or more chatbots that respond to keywords. Each chatbot will be a separate dictionary. Each keyword is a key in the dictionary. Each value is the chatbot's response to the keyword.

For example, you might add the keyword "game" by creating the follow key/value pair:
```
'game':'My favorite game is Fetch.',
```

REQUIREMENTS:
  - Either...
    - Create two dictionary-based chatbots with 12 key/value pairs each
    - Create three dictionary-based chatbots with 8 key/value pairs each

Copy/paste the starter code from the [starter template](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Chatbot-starter-template). Type talkTo(dan) in the console to see the demo.
