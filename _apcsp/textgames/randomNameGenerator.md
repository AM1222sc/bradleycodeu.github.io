title: Random Name Generator

Decide what type of a generator you are going to make. Ideas include: Video Game Titles, Bad Guy Names and Power, NPC Speech Text, Star Wars crawl, Harry Potter characters.

Create at least 3 lists for each noun/verb/adjective/name/place with 12 or more words in each list.

Check out @BookTitleBot for an example: [https://twitter.com/booktitlebot]([https://twitter.com/booktitlebot)  All of these tweets are being randomly generated based on lists of nouns, verbs, names, places, etc.
