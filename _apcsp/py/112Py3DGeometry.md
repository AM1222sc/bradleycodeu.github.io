Copy/paste this starter code: [https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/3d-Geo-starter](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/3d-Geo-starter)

**PICK TWO SHAPES**:
  - Sphere
  - Right Circular Cylinder
  - Right Circular Cone
  - Frustrum of a Cone (aka Conical Frustum)
  - Square Pyramid
  - Torus
  - Regular Tetrahedron

(NOTE: You can NOT do Cube, Prism, or Cuboid/Rectangular Solid)


Directions:
- Create four functions that will *calculate and return*:
    1.  the volume of shape 1
    1.  surface area of shape 1
    1.  volume of shape 2
    1.  surface area of shape 2
- The starter code has a calculateOne function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 1
    - YOU MUST CALL the functions that return the volume of shape 1 and surface area of shape 1
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 1
- The starter code has a calculateTwo function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 2
    - YOU MUST CALL the functions that return the volume of shape 2 and surface area of shape 2
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 2
- Change the label for your first three-dimensional shape
- Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
- The starter code has a button that says "Calculate Shape 1" and when clicked runs the calculateOne function.
- Change the label for your second three-dimensional shape
- Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
- The starter code has a button that says "Calculate Shape 2" and when clicked runs the calculateTwo function.
