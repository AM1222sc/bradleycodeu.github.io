Copy/paste this starter code: [https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/BuySellPhones-starter](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/BuySellPhones-starter)

[Read this tutorial](/apcsp/py/pythonfunctions/)

In this project your will define a function called buyPhones that requires one argument: myDollars. The function will return the amountOfPhones as an whole number. Assume that 1 phone = 399 dollars

Finally, you will test out the sellPhones function and the buyPhones function. You will call a function, pass a argument to the function, and save what it returns as a variable.
