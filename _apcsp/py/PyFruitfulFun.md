Mr. Riley has created 4 weird functions and he needs you to test them to make sure that they work correctly. Write 2 tests for each function (8 total tests).

Test a function by "calling" the function and passing an argument into the function. countVowels("Computer") should return 3.

REMEMBER: Each of these functions *WILL* return a result. You MUST save the result in a variable AND then print that variable.

For example, the code below would test a validYear function. With the argument 2009, the coder is expecting it to say True. Finally, run the test, get the actual result and print it.

```
# Test 1
print("Test 1 of validYear function")
print("Argument: 2009")
print("Expected: True")
# Run the test and get the actual result
actual = validYear(2009)
print("Actual Result: " + str(actual))
```
