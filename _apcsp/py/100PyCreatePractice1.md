Create an Educational Quiz

Computers are playing an increasing role in education.
Write a program that will help a student learn basic fundamentals in math, science, a foreign language, etc.

*This is a TWO PART project: create an Educational Quiz program and write a Written Reflection*

Code Specifications:
	-	Contains at least 5 or more quiz questions
	-	Must use a function to check if the answer is correct or incorrect
	-	Must notify the user if correct or incorrect


### You will turn in *TWO* files:

1. Educational Quiz python program:
	-	Copy/paste this starter code: [https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Create-1-starter-file](https://repl.it/@JustinRiley1/Create-1-starter-file)
	- Create a function called checkAnswer that requires two arguments: userInput, answerString. It returns True or False if the userInput is identical to the answerString.
	- Each person will turn in a copy of your finished Python code

2. Written Reflection:
  - [Create a copy of this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AD-HkxG91RmUEMR6urnpoLyJTMJoNswzmolqJBneUh0/copy) and SHARE it with your partner.
	-	Working with your partner, answer all four questions 2a-2d (*for now*, you can ignore parts that refer to "your video" and "developed individually on your own").
	-	Each person will turn in a copy of this Google Doc
