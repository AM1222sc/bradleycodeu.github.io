Create an Educational Multi-Choice Quiz

Computers are playing an increasing role in education. Write a program that will help a student learn basic fundamentals in math, science, a foreign language, etc.

*This is a TWO PART project: create an Educational Quiz program and write a Written Reflection*

Code Specifications:

	-	Contains at least 5 or more MULTI-CHOICE quiz questions. For example, "Where is the Eiffel Tower? 1 = London, 2 = Paris, 3 = New York, 4 = Tokyo"
	-	Must have a function called validNumber that requires one argument: userInput. It returns True or False if the userInput is between 1 and 4 (inclusive).
	-	Must notify the user if their answer is "correct" or "incorrect"
	-	If the users types in an invalid number (999, for example) then you must notify the user "999 is NOT a valid answer"


### You will turn in *TWO* PDF files:

1. Educational Quiz python program:
	- Each person will turn in a copy of your finished Python code as a PDF file. Why a PDF? Because you will turn in a PDF of your code for the AP exam.

2. Written Reflection:
  - [Create a copy of this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BB8P_41wooVqGAvJW9_JWM1394p5x0H8MDDH4vbAZ78/copy) and SHARE it with your partner.
	-	Working with your partner, answer all of the questions.
