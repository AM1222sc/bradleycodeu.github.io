title: Calling Functions

[Read this tutorial first](/apcsp\py\pythonfunctions)

In this project you will be given 3 function definitions:
  1.  firstVowel
  1.  getVowelName
  1.  nameGame

Your job is to "call" the functions and pass in one or two arguments. Your exact directions are written as comments in the starter code.
I recommend writing your code on the line below each comment. Like this...
```python
# Create a variable called areaCode and assign the value 614
areaCode = 614
```
