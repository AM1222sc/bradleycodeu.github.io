Welcome to the home page for the Community Food Drive! Please Help! Our food banks are excited to have you join the fight against hunger in your community. Keep these things in mind in order to have the greatest impact. Our food pantry has one large shelf of food ready for distribution to needy individuals and families. Perishable items are kept in a large refrigerator and meat is kept in a large freezer. When visiting the pantry, patrons may select needed food items from what is available. Even though much food is donated or received from government surplus, the food pantry still purchases approximately 50% of what is distributed each day.

Before you organize a food drive, make sure you contact your local food bank. The food bank will give you advice. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed consectetur nulla nunc, quis euismod massa tempor in. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Halfway down the hall you will find the “Donation Room” on your left. Please leave all donations on the table. Also, we request that you please take the time to sign the clipboard indicating your name, address and number of bags/boxes/containers of food that you've donated. After signing the clipboard indicating where donations are from, bags and boxes of donations are left on the table inside the room. Throughout the week volunteers count each item donated. After expiration dates are checked, everything is sorted by category to make it easier when stocking the shelves in the food pantry.

We maintain the highest standards of food safety, which means that not every product is suitable for donation. It requires time and effort for the food bank to sort and inspect all donated items to ensure that they are safe. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

To maximize your efforts, we suggest that you also consider a “virtual” food drive to help support your local food bank. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

ABOUT US

--- Insert a photo of "a community center" here ---

Our annual food drive takes place annually. This event is the largest one-day food drive in the metropolitan area and has helped feed those in need since 1991. We strive to provide the most nutritious food for individuals and families in our community. If you are unable to bring items to the food bank at 2828 North Central Avenue, please consider giving a cash donation. For every dollar that you donate, our food bank can buy $12 worth of food using wholesale discounts.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Households are eligible to receive food from the Pantry if the total gross income for the household does not exceed 185% of the federal poverty level. A household can be a single person or a group of persons (related or not) who live as one economic group.  Assets are not included in the gross household income. Eligibility is based on current income status and self-declared eligibility. Households are not required to show proof of income.

People in need of food may visit the Food Pantry once every 30 days to receive food up to a maximum of 12 times per year. Emergency exceptions may be made.  We do not turn people away who say they have no food. At least a small amount of food is given to them. Low-income families, senior citizens and homeless people are eligible to utilize the Food Pantry.  A minimum length of stay is NOT required to prove residency.

  Community Food Drive

  2828 North Central Avenue

  Phoenix, AZ 85000

Our success depends on the time and caring of our donors and volunteers. Please donate non-perishable foods or sign up to volunteer your time. If your family can use it, chances are it's appropriate to donate. With our limited resources, it is best if you deliver food donations directly to the food pantry. It's easy to do. We also gladly accept donations of children’s books for “Kid’s Book Corner”. The pantry has a large bookcase in the waiting room, which is filled with children’s books. Every child may take home one book each time they visit the food pantry.

The most needed non-perishable foods are:

--- create an unordered list here ---

  canned fruits

  canned vegetables

  canned meat and fish

  tomato sauce

  ketchup and other condiments

  breakfast cereal

  instant oatmeal

  powdered milk


PLEASE NOTE : The food pantry does not distribute expired food or food received in compromised packages (dented cans, crushed boxes, damaged bottles or lids, opened packages, etc). As the donated food is hand-sorted by volunteers, it's checked for expiration dates and package integrity.  All food items that are outdated or exposed due to package failure will be considered unfit for human consumption and discarded. Please remember this when collecting and/or donating food so the food donated will be of the highest quality, safe to consume and have a substantial shelf life for distribution purposes.


Donations that we can NOT accept:

--- create an ordered list here ---

  Anything expired, damaged, stained, spoiled or rusting

  Medicines and medical equipment

  Tires, batteries or light bulbs

  Garbage or trash

  Anything unhygienic

  Printer inks, toners

  Anything dangerous

We are looking for volunteers at 2 locations... the post office beginning at 11 am and the food pantry beginning between 12:30 and 1 pm. At the post office, volunteers are needed to pack the food into boxes for transport to the pantry. At the pantry, we will need strong bodies to get the large post office carts inside, to the storage room in the basement and then stack the boxes until needed. Please remember do not donate damaged, expired or opened food products. These items need to be thrown away. The collection portion of the food drive is normally complete by 6 pm.

If you are not able to help on the day of the food drive, consider helping us out with the aftermath of such a large food collection. Volunteers work for many, many weeks sorting the food by category and then sorting by expiration date. If you can help in any way possible, please contact Dawn, our volunteer coordinator. Whatever time you can donate would be greatly appreciated! Last year’s silver-anniversary event brought in more than 71 million pounds of non-perishable food that was collected from generous postal patrons and delivered to community food pantries. Overall, NALC was able to provide critically needed goods to local food distribution centers in EVERY state. The tally for last year’s drive was 71million pounds of food collected in more than 10,000 cities and towns in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This figure brought the quarter-century total to more than 1.5 billion pounds.
