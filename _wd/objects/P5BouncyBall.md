Here is the link to the P5.js reference: [https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape)

You MUST have:

  - A square or rectangle that shows the "walls"
  - An object to keep track of the ball's x, y, xSpeed, and ySpeed

Use the size of your square/rectangle to determine the walls. If your square is 500 x 500, then the lowest x-coordinate is 0 and the largest x-coordinate is 500. The lowest y-coordinate is 0 and the largest y-coordinate is 500.
