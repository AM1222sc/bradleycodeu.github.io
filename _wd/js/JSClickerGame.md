title: JS Clicker Game
---
Create a clicker game that tracks how many times you have clicked a button and uses innerHTML to update/display that number with each click. Have three rewards that unlock after a certain number of clicks (for example... 5 clicks, 10 clicks, 20 clicks). If the number of clicks equals one of these levels, then alert the player and display a previously hidden reward image.
