Watch this video about how [Simpler is Better](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hpUxydU5K0Lv9N_UkXRrQDSfIBxV8RAp) in web design.

Log in to [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/create?lang=html) using your school Google account. Then click the blue NEW TRINKET button and select HTML.

Create a simple webpage (for a business, sports team, school club, rock band, etc) with a Title, Heading (H1), and three simple details in normal text on three separate lines (motto or slogan, fake phone number, fake building address, fake email, fake store hours, etc).

Use the [center tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.asp) to center text on the page. Later, we will learn how to center text using CSS instead.

Finally, create a simple logo for your business, sports team, school club, rock band, etc.
  - Use Photoshop to create the logo
  - Save it as a jpg
  - Upload the jpg into your Trinket project by clicking the View/Add Images icon in the center of the screen.
  - Use [the img tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) to insert the image into the page
