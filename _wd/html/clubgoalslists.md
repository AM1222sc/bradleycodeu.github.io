Watch this [KhanAcademy tutorial about HTML lists](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/pt/html-lists)

Think of a name for your fake club (for example, Bradley Flat Earth Society). Have the name as a heading (H1), that is *centered* and at the top of the page.

Next list your club goals as an UNORDERED list. For example...

## Our Goals for Members:

  - Members will gain a positive attitude
  - Members will achieve sublime happiness
  - Members will pay dues in cash or check

Next give some steps that members of the club will follow as an ORDERED list. For example...

## Directions to Our Meeting Place:

  1.  Find some pixie dust and sprinkle it on yourself
  1.  Think of a wonderful thought
  1.  Fly toward the second star to the right, and a straight-on 'til morning
