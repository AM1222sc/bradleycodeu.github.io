Watch this [KhanAcademy tutorial about HTML lists](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/pt/html-lists)

Continue working on your webpage from the Simpler Is Better project. At the top of the page you should have the name for your fake business, sports team, school club, rock band, etc (for example, Bradley Flat Earth Society). Have the name as a heading (H1), that is *centered* and at the top of the page. Below the heading, you should already have a logo.

Next add your club goals as an UNORDERED list. For example...

Our Goals for Members:

  - Members will gain a positive attitude
  - Members will achieve sublime happiness
  - Members will pay dues in cash or check

Next give some steps that members of the club will follow as an ORDERED list. For example...

Directions to Our Meeting Place:

  1.  Find some pixie dust and sprinkle it on yourself
  1.  Think of a wonderful thought
  1.  Fly toward the second star to the right, and a straight-on 'til morning

A few things to note for this project...

  - Lists look best when they are not centered
  - You should not have paragraphs inside of your list items. Don't do this... &lt;li> &lt;p> text &lt;/p> &lt;/li>
  - You should have BOTH an unordered list with Club Goals AND an ordered list with Directions

Turn in your repl.it URL when finished
