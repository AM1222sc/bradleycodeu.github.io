NOTE: The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate that you *CAN* create a webpage using Notepad (the most basic text editor). In the future, we will be using better programs/websites that have features that will help us code.

Read [Web Fundamentals 2.1.1](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/webfundamentals/HTML/intro.html#my-first-heading) to help you get started.

  - Using Notepad, create your own unique "Hello World" HTML file.
