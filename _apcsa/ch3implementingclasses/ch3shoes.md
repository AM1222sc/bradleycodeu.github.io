Create a Shoes class and its tester file, ShoesTester.

![ShoesTester screenshot](/apcsa\ch3implementingclasses\shoes.png)

1.	Write the Shoes class that is being accessed by the ShoesTester class.
2.	Create the ShoesTester class. No user input, so no scanner.
3.  Within the toString method, generate the model number using the lowercase first letter of the brand, the lowercase first letter of the type, the lowercase color, and the size.
4.	Run ShoesTester and debug if necessary.

### Expected Output

The expected output for the code in the screenshot above is...
```
Color: Blue, Brand: Nike, Type: Golf, Size: 9.5, Model Number: ngblue9.5
```
A different test of the Shoes class could result in the following output...
```
Color: Red, Brand: Puma, Type: Sneakers, Size: 8, Model Number: psred8
```
