Write while loops that will print

1. All squares less than n. For example, if n is 100, print 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81.

1. All positive numbers that are divisible by 10 and less than n. For example, if n is 100, print 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90.

1. All powers of two less than n. For example, if n is 100, print 1 2 4 8 16 32 64.


Sample output:
```
Gimme a positive integer: 100
Squares less than 100 = 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81
Tens less than 100 = 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90
Power of two less than 100 = 1 2 4 8 16 32 64
```
