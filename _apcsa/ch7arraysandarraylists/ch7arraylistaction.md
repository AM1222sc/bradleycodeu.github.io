Manipulate data stored in an ArrayList.

Part 1:

  - The create an ArrayList that will store 10 to 19 random integers from 1 to 100. Each time you run the app the ArrayList could be a different length.

  - Print “Initial random ArrayList = “ the print the contents of the ArrayList.

Part 2:

  - Print “Smallest value = “ then find and print the smallest value stored in the ArrayList.

  - Print “Sum = “ then calculate and print the sum of all items in the ArrayList.

  - Compute the sum of the array values, EXCEPT for the smallest one. Print “Sum without smallest = “ and print the sum of all items except for the smallest.

Part 3:

  - Shift all elements to the right by one and move the last element into the first position. For example, 1  4  9  16  25 would be transformed into 25  1  4  9  16.

  - Print “Shifted ArrayList = “ then Print the new array.

Part 4:

  - Replace all even elements with 0. For example, 56  23  19  14 would be transformed into 0  23  19  0.

  - Print “Even values replaced = “ then print the new ArrayList.
