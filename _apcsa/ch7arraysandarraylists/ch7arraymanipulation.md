title: Array Manipulation
---
Manipulate data stored in an array.

Part A: The initial array must store 10 random integers from 1 to 100.

Print “Initial random array = “ Print the array.

Print “Smallest value = “

Find and print the smallest value stored in the array

Print “Sum = “
Calculate and print the sum of all items in the array
Compute the sum of the array values, except for the smallest one.

Print “Sum without smallest = “

Print the sum of all items except for the smallest

Part C: Shift all elements to the right by one and move the last element into the first position. For example, 1  4  9  16  25 would be transformed into 25  1  4  9  16.

Print “Shifted array = “ Print the new array.

Part D: Replace all even elements with 0. For example, 56  23  19  14 would be transformed into 0  23  19  0.

Print “Even values replaced = “ Print the new array.
