Write a Java program to prompt the user to enter their name. Your program will respond with a welcome message for the user, followed by some information about the user's name.

Sample Output:
```
Enter your name: Andrew
Hello Andrew!
Your name is 6 letters long.
Your name starts with a A.
The letter r is at the center of your name.
Your name ends with a w.
Goodbye Andrew!
```
Try running your code with a different variety of inputs. What happens if you just hit the ENTER key instead of entering a name?
