Write a Java program to prompt the user to enter their name. Your program will respond with a welcome message for the user, followed by some information about the user's name.

Sample Output:
```
Enter your name: Andrew
Hello Andrew!
Your name is 6 letters long.
Your name starts with a A.
The letter r is at the center of your name.
Your name ends with a w.
Goodbye Andrew!
```
Try running your code with a different variety of inputs. What happens if you just hit the ENTER key instead of entering a name?

You MUST also complete one or more of the challenges:

  - CHALLENGE 1: Prompt for the user's last name, then automatically generate 10 suggested usernames for that person. For example... jriley, rileyj, juriley, rileyju, justinr, justinri, jr3487, etc

  - CHALLENGE 2: Write cava jode... I mean, java code... that will prompt for the user's nast lame... I mean, last name... then generate a Spoonerism using their first and last name [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism)

  - CHALLENGE 3: With the user's first name, generate a verse for the 1964 Shirley Ellis song "The Name Game" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game). Create a method called findFirstVowel that takes a string as argument and returns the index of the first vowel or returns 0 if no vowels. Create a method called vowelName that takes a string as argument, calls findFirstVowel, and returns  In your main method, use getVowelName to help you. If the name starts with a b, f, or m, that sound simply is not repeated. For example: Billy becomes "Billy Billy bo-illy"; Fred becomes "bonana fanna fo-red"; Marsha becomes "fee fi mo-arsha"
