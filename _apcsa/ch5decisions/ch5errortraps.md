Conditional statements are often used to catch input values that are inaccurate.

Write a program that prompts the user to provide a single character from the alphabet. Print Vowel or Consonant, depending on the user input.

Print an error message if the user input...
  - is not a letter (between a and z or A and Z)
  - is an empty string
  - is a string longer than one character


*Try to make your program as efficient as possible.*
