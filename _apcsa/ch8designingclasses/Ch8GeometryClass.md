Write static methods

- public static double cubeVolume(double h)
- public static double cubeSurface(double h)
- public static double cylinderVolume(double r, double h)
- public static double cylinderSurface(double r, double h)

that compute the volume and surface area of a cube with height h, and a cylinder with radius r and height h. Place them into a class called Geometry. Then write a tester program that prompts the user for the values of r and h, calls all four methods, and prints the results formatted with printf and rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Sample output (formatted with printf and rounded to the nearest hundredth)
```
Cube volume:           166.38
Cube surface area:     181.50
Cylinder volume:        50.27
Cylinder surface area:  75.40
```
