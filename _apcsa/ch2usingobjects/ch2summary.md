Summary of Chapters 1 & 2
*/

// 1) Write the import statement for the Rectangle class


// 2) Write the import statement for the Random class


// 3) Write the import statement needed for question 8 (below)


public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// 4) Write MULTIPLE output statements that will produce a smiley face


		// 5) Write a program that constructs a Rectangle object square with
		//    top-left corner (100, 100) and side length 200, prints its location,
		//    applies the grow and translate methods, and prints the location again.
		//    The calls to grow and translate should modify the square so that it
		//    has half the width and half the length, and is centered in the
		//    original square.


		// 6) Simulate a dice roll. Generate and print a random integer between 1 and 6, inclusive.


		// 7) Pick a random HS year. Generate and print a random integer between 9 and 12, inclusive.


		// 8) Display the day of the week that Mr. Riley's birthday (June 15th) was on this year.


		// 9) Calculate and display the number of letters in the word "Bradley".


		// 10) Finally, visit http://patorjk.com/software/taag/ to get a fancy ASCII art version of your LAST name. For example, Amy Brown would print Brown. Use println statements to print your ASCII art last name.
