Create *ONE* Java program that does *ALL* of the following:

R2.9 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it to "HELLO". Use the toUpperCase method.

R2.10 Write Java statements that initialize a string message with "Hello" and then change it to "hello". Use the replace method.

E2.3 Write code that initializes a string with "Mississippi". Then replace all "i" with "ii" and print the length of the resulting string. In that string, replace all "ss" with "s" and print the length of the resulting string.

E2.8 The StringBuilder class has a method for reversing a string. [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html) Write code to construct a StringBuilder object from a given string (such as "desserts"), call the reverse method followed by the toString method, and print the result. Also print the expected value.
